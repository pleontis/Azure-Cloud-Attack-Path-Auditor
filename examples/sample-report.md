# Azure Cloud Attack Path Audit Report (Sample)

Assessment Type: Cloud Security and Attack Path Analysis  
Platform: Microsoft Azure  
Scope: Single Azure Subscription  
Generated By: Azure Cloud Attack Path Auditor  
Report Type: Showcase Sample Output

## Executive Summary

This assessment identified critical identity and access management misconfigurations that could enable full subscription compromise if exploited by a malicious actor.

The most severe findings involve over-privileged identities combined with long-lived service principal secrets, creating realistic attack paths aligned with real-world Azure breaches.

## Severity Overview

| Severity | Count |
|---------|-------|
| CRITICAL | 2 |
| HIGH    | 1 |
| MEDIUM  | 1 |
| LOW     | 0 |

---

## Key Findings Summary

- Over-privileged Owner identities at subscription scope
- Service principals with long-lived client secrets
- Correlated attack paths enabling full subscription takeover
- Identity-based privilege escalation scenarios

---

## Detailed Findings

---

### Finding 1: Over-Privileged Owner Identities

Severity: CRITICAL  
Category: Identity and Access Management  
Scope: Subscription

Description:  
Multiple identities were found assigned the Owner role at the subscription level. This role grants unrestricted administrative privileges.

Affected Identities:
- user: admin@contoso.com
- servicePrincipal: ci-cd-pipeline-sp

Impact:  
Compromise of any Owner identity results in full subscription takeover.

Recommendation:
- Minimize Owner role assignments
- Replace Owner with least-privileged roles
- Continuously audit privileged identities

---

### Finding 2: Service Principals with Long-Lived Secrets

Severity: HIGH  
Category: Credential Management  
Scope: Azure Active Directory

Description:  
Service principals were identified with client secrets exceeding recommended rotation periods.

Affected Service Principals:
- ci-cd-pipeline-sp
  - Secret validity: 365 days

Impact:  
Long-lived secrets increase exposure through CI/CD systems, logs, and source code leaks.

Recommendation:
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Enforce short-lived credentials
- Prefer managed identities

---

### Finding 3: Subscription Takeover Attack Path Detected

Severity: CRITICAL  
Category: Attack Path Analysis

Description:  
A complete attack path to subscription takeover was identified through the combination of exposed service principal credentials and Owner-level permissions.

Attack Path:
1. Service principal secret is compromised
2. Attacker authenticates to Azure
3. Owner permissions are leveraged
4. Full subscription control is achieved

Impact:
- Complete loss of control
- Resource destruction or ransomware
- Persistence via additional identities

Recommendation:
- Remove Owner role from automation identities
- Rotate exposed credentials immediately
- Implement monitoring and alerting

---

### Finding 4: Identity-Based Privilege Escalation Risk

Severity: MEDIUM  
Category: Privilege Escalation

Description:  
RBAC configurations allow indirect privilege escalation through role inheritance and misconfigured scopes.

Recommendation:
- Review role assignment scopes
- Apply strict least privilege
- Audit escalation paths regularly
